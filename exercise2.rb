#1. How would you calculate a good tip for a 55 dollar meal? Use puts to print the answer.


puts "The tip amount for 55 dollars is #{55 * 0.2}"

# Try adding a string and an interger with the + operator. Find a way to convert into a string

puts "Kathleen" + ' ' + '5'
# Try outputting the result of 45628 multiplied by 7839 in a sentence by using string interpolation.

puts "#{45628 * 7839} is the result of multiplying 45628 by 7839"

# Whats the value expression

puts (10 < 20 && 30 < 20) || !(10 == 11)
# True
